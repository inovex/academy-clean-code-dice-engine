# Dice Engine - An exercise sandbox

This repository contains a basic project setup for the "Clean Code: Naming" training.

## Environment Setup

This repository can be used with the Java IDE of your choosing and a JRE of version 17 and higher.
While renaming and restructuring of the code, the existing tests must be kept running successful. The test code can also be improved but should not be disabled.

## Exercise One

Please inspect the [Requirements document](documentation/Requirements.pdf) and extract names for the core concepts and functional units of a possible implementation.

## Exercise Two

Have a look at the package [`src/de/inovex/cleancode/diceengine`](src/de/inovex/cleancode/diceengine) and its contained classes.
Please improve the naming of structural elements, where possible.

## Exercise Three

Now, go over to the subpackage [`src/de/inovex/cleancode/diceengine/probability`](src/de/inovex/cleancode/diceengine/probability) and see if you can get to a readable and easily understandable code structure by renaming, extraction of functions and moving parts of the implementation into suitable classes, interfaces, enums and packages.
